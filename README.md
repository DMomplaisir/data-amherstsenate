Amherst Senate Data Reporting
================

This repo is centered around analyzing data from the Amherst Senate and Budgetary Committe meetings, decisions, and budget allocations. I'll be collecting data for a bit, and placing it in a format that allows me to possibly develop data vizualizations to support students in learning about their government. 

Next Steps
---------
* Collect all meeting minutes, and agendas available. 
* Clean the data from assorted Google Docs and Excel files into clean JSON datasets.
* Determine which language we're going to utilize to analyze. 
* Create vizualizations for budget allocations. 
* Determine a way to categorize discretionary spending. 
* Work with a reporter in Amherst Student to delineate insights.
